# This script takes two TXT files with read names and filters out the reads present in both files. 
# Then it takes FASTQ file and returnes FASTQ only with reads present in only one of the two TXT files.
# Input - two TXT files with multimappers from genome and plasmid, one FASTQ file with multimappers.
# Output - FASTQ file with reads that are present only in one of the two TXT files.
